abstract = {ABSTRACT This study delves into social engineering vulnerabilities among cybersecurity experts, using an experimental approach. The motivation is to challenge the assumption that cybersecurity professionals are immune to social engineering attacks by examining their susceptibility to emerging threats like quishing, identifying gaps in current practices and training programs, and raising awareness about the risks posed to the general public. Two scenarios involving QR codes offering free training sessions and promotional hoodie giveaways were set up at and despite ethical considerations, the experiment yielded enlightening results: around 19\% of participants interacted with the QR codes, questioning the perceived invulnerability of cybersecurity experts to such tactics. These results question the feasibility of traditional educational approaches in fully mitigating such risks, highlighting the need for updated and effective training, innovative strategies, and automated defenses to better protect both professionals and the general public from evolving social engineering threats.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT In the inevitably hi-tech universe of cybercrimes, one of the major still prevailing methods is the usage of the malicious URLs and creating a Phishing link to obtain user credentials from the people. This method is highly subtle and has more effect on people's lives as well as corporate loss. To identify the malicious URLs, the security community has listed blacklists and benign links online. Still, as the technology is being developed day by day, the attackers try to create new phishing URLs using new social engineering methods that could be easily forged into the user's account. To improve the generality of malicious URL detectors, machine-learning techniques have been explored with increasing attention in recent years. This article addresses the detection of malicious URLs combining the intelligence of both the heuristic-based method and the machine learning process. It has been found that there are many possibilities for detecting zero-day attacks and spear-phishing attacks when incorporating both lexical features and machine learning methods. Out of the six-batch learning process analyzed, we implement a decision tree algorithm in our framework with 99.47\% accuracy during evaluation. The true positive values gained in our proposed hybrid framework is 99.2\% and indicate <1\% of the false-positive values. The implementation shows a precision level higher than the previous model developed and by other antiphishing techniques. A high detection rate on zero-day and spear-phishing attacks and overall results reveal that our system outclasses the current approach to detecting phishing scams.},

abstract = {Abstract It is a known fact that cybercriminals often manipulate people to steal sensitive information. However, there has been a lack of research in investigating cybercriminals' strategies and the evolution of strategies when crafting phishing emails to entice people to perform a variety of malicious tasks such as clicking on fraudulent links. This study uses a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP), topic modeling, and clustering techniques to analyze and evaluate the persuasive techniques/strategies, which cybercriminals use when crafting fraudulent emails. Our experimental results revealed the efficacy of using these techniques in understanding cybercriminals' mindset as well as how certain aspects of these techniques maintained consistency despite the evolution of the strategy from early Nigerian scams to more modern phishing emails. The findings of our study indicate that the most common technique/strategy used by cybercriminals is a combination of creating a sense of urgency while promising a reward. Moreover, despite the evolution of technology, cybercriminals are still effectively using the same persuasive techniques. Based on our findings, we provided several recommendations to improve anti-phishing software and awareness and training programs.},

abstract = {While antiphishing techniques have evolved over the years, phishing remains one of the most threatening attacks on current network security. This is because phishing exploits one of the weakest links in a network system—people. The purpose of this research is to predict the possible phishing victims. In this study, we propose the multidimensional phishing susceptibility prediction model (MPSPM) to implement the prediction of user phishing susceptibility. We constructed two types of emails: legitimate emails and phishing emails. We gathered 1105 volunteers to join our experiment by recruiting volunteers. We sent these emails to volunteers and collected their demographic, personality, knowledge experience, security behavior, and cognitive processes by means of a questionnaire. We then applied 7 supervised learning methods to classify these volunteers into two categories using multidimensional features: susceptible and nonsusceptible. The experimental results indicated that some machine learning methods have high accuracy in predicting user phishing susceptibility, with a maximum accuracy rate of 89.04\%. We conclude our study with a discussion of our findings and their future implications.},

The unprecedented cybersecurity concerns emerged during the pandemic sparked a torrent of research to investigate cyber-attacks and to propose solutions and countermeasures. Within the scamdemic, phishing was by far the most frequent type of attack. This survey paper reviews, summarises, compares and critically discusses 54 scientific studies and many reports by governmental bodies, security firms and the grey literature that investigated phishing attacks during COVID-19, or that proposed countermeasures against them. Our analysis identifies the main characteristics of the attacks and the main scientific trends for defending against them, thus highlighting current scientific challenges and promising avenues for future research and experimentation.},

Numerous taxonomy-based systems have been proposed in both the academic literature and industrial practice to classify cyber risk threats. However, the fragmentation of various approaches has resulted in a plethora of taxonomies, often incongruent with one another. In this study, we undertake a comprehensive review of these alternative taxonomies and offer a common framework for their classification based on their scope. Furthermore, we introduce desirable properties of a taxonomy, which enable comparisons of different taxonomies with the same scope. Finally, we discuss the managerial implications stemming from the utilization of each taxonomy class to support decision-making processes.},

abstract = {Abstract Cybersecurity specialists face continual challenges in protecting organizations and societies from ever-evolving cyberattacks. These challenges intensify dramatically in the context of war, yet our understanding of cyberattacks during wartime is limited. This is in part because it is difficult to gather information about cyberattacks and cybersecurity in highly tense wartime environments. Against this backdrop, we present evidence from a unique case study that examines cyberattacks and cybersecurity issues in the context of the Russian-Ukraine war. Compared with peacetime, the nature of cyberattacks in wartime both intensifies and expands. During armed conflict, nation-state funded cyberattacks are typically better financed, more prolonged, and have concrete aims, including to disrupt military operations, sabotage infrastructure, spark civil unrest, and spread disinformation. Countries at war experience extreme pressures due to resource scarcity, poverty, and societal conflicts, all of which make it difficult to effectively manage cyberattack threats and experiences. Based on interviews with public authority representatives in Ukraine, our study found four main challenges to managing cyberattacks during wartime. First, limited financial resources were a major hindrance. Decision-makers said that they were forced to set tough economic priorities and to oscillate between allocating resources to physical assets (e.g., conventional military operations and rebuilding infrastructure devasted by bombing) and to cybersecurity. In such situations, cybersecurity came in second to more immediate wartime needs; this complicated sufficient investment in IT infrastructure, cyber-awareness training, and implementing response plans. Second, the country faced serious recruitment difficulties. Attracting IT and cyber personnel has been hard—and sometimes impossible—as the war forced people to leave the country or parts of it, and many IT professionals left the field to become soldiers. Further, salary disparities between the public and private sectors, as well as regional differences, thwarted recruitment efforts in certain areas of the country. Inappropriate human behaviors, such as clicking insecure links, poor password practices, and using risky apps, always pose significant cyberattack risks. War magnifies these challenges due to lack of training, as well as to increased financial incentives for employees to compromise security. Unclear cybersecurity guidelines added an extra layer of complexity in managing cyberattacks. Public authority representatives at the local level said that they lacked the clear, actionable guidelines they needed for cyberattack management in a wartime situation plagued by resource scarcity. These four challenges are not unique to wartime situations; all are recognized in the cybersecurity literature covering routine IT contexts. However, our study illustrates how these four cyberattack challenges are magnified, entail critical dilemmas, and are more difficult to manage during wartime, not least because prioritizing cybersecurity is a challenge in itself. Hence, while Ukraine had upgraded its digital government capacities before the war, and government actors have attempted to continue managing ongoing cyberattack challenges—including adapting legislation and providing cyber-awareness training for public servants to decrease inappropriate human behaviors—effectively managing cyberattack threats has remained extremely difficult. Our article contributes new insights into the challenges of managing cyberattacks in extreme situations. We showcase the challenges and dilemmas in wartime and offer practice-based knowledge on cyberattacks and cybersecurity efforts in highly tense environments.},

abstract = {Security negligence, a major cause of data breaches, occurs when an organization's information technology management fails to adequately address security vulnerabilities. By conducting a field quasi-experiment using outgoing spam as a focal security issue, this study investigates the effectiveness of reputational sanctions in reducing security negligence in a global context. In the quasi-experiment, a reputational sanction mechanism based on outgoing spam was established for four countries, and for each country, reputational sanctions were imposed on the 10 organizations with the largest outgoing spam volumes—that is, these organizations were listed publicly. We find that because of our reputational sanction mechanism, organizations in the four countries, including those that were not listed, reduced outgoing spam significantly compared to those in similar countries. Within each country, the listed organizations, whose reputations were actually sanctioned, reduced spam to a greater extent than those that were not listed. The spam reduction in the not-listed organizations is mainly driven by increased security awareness, while the reduction in the listed organizations is primarily due to reputation effect. Among the listed organizations, those ranked lower were more responsive to the reputational sanctions. Moreover, we find that reputational sanctions have a stronger effect on large organizations and important organizations that provide network access and transit to others.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT This study explores the impact of data breaches on corporate tax planning in the United States. The results reveal that when a firm's headquarter is located in a state that has adopted a data breach notification (DBN) law, there is a significant 3.8\% decrease in the long-term effective tax rate. This reduction translates to annual tax savings of approximately \$8.13 million. Furthermore, tax sheltering is found to decrease by 19.17\% compared to the sample average. These effects are particularly pronounced in financially constrained firms and those operating in high-tech industries. The findings suggest that after the introduction of mandatory data breach disclosure requirements, firms are less inclined to engage in aggressive tax avoidance practices, which could otherwise lead to increased litigation costs. Instead, they prioritize efficient tax planning strategies to improve after-tax cash flows.},
