 abstract = {Purpose
Cyberfraud is a global problem, which has negative impacts on the financial institutions, global economy and the public. The existing policy and regulatory frameworks for mitigating cyberfraud in South African banks are not holistic, thus, the purpose of this study is to develop a holistic policy and regulatory framework that integrates the legal, governance, internal control and supervisory frameworks for cyberfraud mitigation in the South African banking industry.
Method
ology: The study employs a mixed method comprising of both qualitative and quantitative approaches. A structured questionnaire was developed and made available to selected members of staff of the 17 licensed banks in South Africa. These experts deal directly with the banking operations, administration and customers\textquotesingle  services. Non-parametric statistical analysis, specifically the Chi-square, Fischer\textquotesingle s Exact, Spearman\textquotesingle s correlation and cross tabulation statistics, were employed for the statistical analysis of the data gathered from the survey. From the outcome of the survey, a simplified policy and regulatory framework was developed for the mitigation of the effects of cyberfraud in order to enhance the performance of South African banks.
Findings
The outcome of the survey indicated that there is a relationship between the methods of cyberfraud identification and the occurrence of cyberfraud in the South African banking industry. Furthermore, the methods of cyberfraud identification were presumed to be effective based on the evidence presented in this study. Despite this, the effect of cyberfraud perpetration was still found to be detrimental to the South African banks.
Practical implications
This study presents a simplified and executable policy as well as regulatory framework for mitigating cyberfaud in South African banks. The proposed policies and regulations are geared towards improving cyber resilience and minimising the effects of cyberfraud occurrences.
Novelty
Existing works have not sufficiently reported on the integrated policy and regulatory framework for mitigating cyberfraud. Thus, this study developed a simplified integrated policy and regulatory framework for mitigating cyberfraud to enhance the performance of South African banks in the area of cyberfraud mitigation.},

 abstract = {This study analyzed the Coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis from the angle of cyber-crime,highlighting the wide spectrum of cyberattacks that occurred around the world. The modus operandi of cyberattack campaigns was revealed by analyzing and considering cyberattacks in the context of major world events. Following what appeared to be substantial gaps between the initial breakout of the virus and the first COVID-19-related cyber-attack, the investigation indicates how attacks became significantly more frequent over time, to the point where three or four different cyber-attacks were reported on certain days. This study contributes in the direction of fifteen types of cyber-attacks which were identified as the most common pattern and its ensuing devastating events during the global COVID-19 crisis. The paper is unique because it covered the main types of cyber-attacks that most organizations are currently facing and how to address them. An intense look into the recent advances that cybercriminals leverage, the dynamism, calculated measures to tackle it, and never-explored perspectives are some of the integral parts which make this review different from other present reviewed papers on the COVID-19 pandemic. A qualitative methodology was used to provide a robust response to the objective used for the study. Using a multi-criteria decision-making problem-solving technique, many facets of cybersecurity that have been affected during the pandemic were then quantitatively ranked in ascending order of severity. The data was generated between March 2020 and December 2021, from a global survey through online contact and responses, especially from different organizations and business executives. The result show differences in cyber-attack techniques; as hacking attacks was the most frequent with a record of 330 out of 895 attacks, accounting for 37\%. Next was Spam emails attack with 13\%; emails with 13\%; followed by malicious domains with 9\%. Mobile apps followed with 8\%, Phishing was 7\%, Malware 7\%, Browsing apps with 6\%, DDoS has 6\%, Website apps with 6\%, and MSMM with 6\%. BEC frequency was 4\%, Ransomware with 2\%, Botnet scored 2\% and APT recorded 1\%. The study recommends that it will continue to be necessary for governments and organizations to be resilient and innovative in cybersecurity decisions to overcome the current and future effects of the pandemic or similar crisis, which could be long-lasting. Hence, this study\textquotesingle s findings will guide the creation, development, and implementation of more secure systems to safeguard people from cyber-attacks.},

Attachment-driven Spear-phishing struggles to succeed against many email providers’ malware-filtration systems, which proactively check emails for malicious software. In this paper, we provided a solution that can detect targeted Spear-phishing attacks based on required similarities in the specific domain which it has been targeted. The strategy is to figure out whether the domain is genuine or a forgery, which is to be evaluated by multi novel grading algorithms. Therefore, this research addresses targeted attacks on specific organisations by presenting a new enterprise solution. This detection system focuses on domain names, which tend to be registered domain names trusted by the victims. The results from this investigation show that this detection system has proven its ability to reduce email phishing attacks significantly.},

The objective of this paper is to examine the role of human factors in the cybersecurity landscape of both smart and cognitive cities. Through a literature review, we investigate how human interactions with digital infrastructures impact security and privacy. We highlight the need to address human errors, social engineering attacks, and insider threats while distinguishing how differences in infrastructure, intelligence, and citizen roles between smart and cognitive cities shape the management of human-centric vulnerabilities. Our review of existing research on integrating human behavioral data into AI systems suggests significant threat detection and response improvements. The findings suggest that human-centric AI detection tools not only mitigate risks of human errors and latent failures but also significantly improve protection for vulnerable populations, thereby promoting stronger human-AI collaboration. Ultimately, this paper advocates for advancing these tools to bolster urban cybersecurity frameworks.},

The study attempts to reveal the degree of awareness of students of the University of Jordan about electronic crimes related to e-learning and the legal procedures and penalties related to electronic crimes in e-learning. Quantitative research methods were used. A questionnaire was established and distributed to students enrolled in the following online courses: Ethics and Human Values, Communication Skills, and National Culture. Analysis of the data revealed that students had a high awareness about cybercrime due to the widespread use of the internet by students as it became an integral part of their daily lives. The degree of awareness of student about legal procedures and penalties related to electronic crimes in e-learning was medium. This indicates students\textquotesingle  lack of awareness of the effectiveness of procedures and penalties for electronic crimes that can be applied in e-learning due to the rapid transition in the learning process at the University of Jordan from traditional learning to distance e-learning that was imposed during the Corona pandemic. Based on these findings, the study presented a set of recommendations that could be implemented to increase awareness and maximize the benefit of using e-learning.},

We review the phishing literature on psychological attacks and design tactics employed for deception by attackers. The result reveals the need to continuously identify tactics embedded in fraudulent email content to understand why users still fall prey to phishing attacks. Using the literature as a backdrop, we identify and conceptualize a thematic dimensional framework of fraudulent phishing attacks. This study uses benchmark datasets of fraudulent email to empirically validate the proposed dimensional framework. Specifically, a combination of machine learning-based content analysis and topic modeling found a majority of the discovered topics were labeled against the proposed dimensions. Statistical analysis was employed to provide empirical evidence of the thematic dimensions of fraudulent email attacks. This study thus, not only extends the cybersecurity literature by identifying and validating eight dimensions that enrich our understanding of phishing and attack identification but stimulates cumulative research endeavors to develop yet more comprehensive dimensional frameworks of phishing email attacks.},

 abstract = {Even though several authentication methods exist, passwords remain the most common type of authentication. Researchers have demonstrated the influence of a person’s environment and exposure to the Internet on their online security behavior (Bosnjak \& Brumen, 2016; He et al., 2021; Juozapavi{\v c}ius et al., 2022). Those studies suggest that social identity seems to play a role in password choice. The objective of this study was to determine if the criminal nature of a network influences password-creation strategies. To achieve this, we utilized two databases with a substantial number of actual passwords (1485,095) that had been leaked to the Internet. One database was sourced from a non-delinquent social network, while the other was from a hacker forum. We employed logistic regression to reveal the characteristics associated with each group, ensuring a comprehensive analysis of different types of password strategies and the similarity between actors of the same network. Results show that users of the same network have passwords with characteristics that are similar to each other. Individuals with the same social interests seem more likely to use the same password-creation strategies. From a network analysis perspective, the results show that similar individuals (sharing the same interests) are similar in other aspects (password creation strategies). These findings offer valuable insights into the diverse landscape of password varieties and user behaviors, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of internet user networks.},

Often, phishers discuss these attack vectors in dark forums. Further, the probability of phishing attacks and the subsequent loss suffered by the firm are highly correlated. In this context, we propose a hybrid framework using explainable AI techniques to assess cyber-risks generated from correlated phishing attacks. The first phase computes the probability of expert phishers within a community of similar attackers with varying expertise. The second phase calculates the probability of phishing attacks upon a firm even after it has invested in IT security and adopted regulatory steps. The third phase categorises phishing and genuine URLs using various machine-learning-based classifiers. Next, it estimates the joint distribution of phishing attacks using an exponential-beta distribution and quantifies the expected loss using Archimedean Copula. Finally, we offer recommendations for firms through the computation of optimal investments in cyber-insurance versus IT security. First, based on the risk attitude of a firm, it can use this explainable-AI (XAI) framework to optimally invest in building security into its enterprise architecture and plan for cyber-risk mitigation strategies. Second, we identify a long-tail phenomenon demonstrated by the losses suffered during most cyber-attacks, which are not one-off incidents and are correlated. Third, contrary to the belief that cyber-insurance markets are ineffective, it can guide financial firms to design realistic cyber-insurance products.},

The information content of cyber breach reports is examined in light of Principle 15 of the 2017 Committee on Sponsoring Organizations Enterprise Risk Management (COSO ERM) information security control framework to understand the degree to which cyber breach reports reflect the established COSO internal control framework. This study utilizes the COSO ERM internal control framework to examine whether current cyber breach reports contain information that may influence a firm’s ability to assess substantial change within its industry due to external forces (COSO ERM Principle 15). As such, this study focuses on data breaches, a special type of cyber incident, which may result in the loss of confidential information. Cyber decision makers rely on this type of information to calibrate information security programs to ensure coverage of relevant threats and the efficient use of available funds. These reports may be used for the purposes of cybersecurity risk assessment and strategic planning. We compare, contrast, and analyzie the reports to identify their utility in such contexts. We also provide an overview of the current cybersecurity reporting environment and suggest revisions to US national cyber policy with the intent of increasing the benefit to reporters and consumers of the data. This study is focused on education as to the current structure of breach reporting based upon our review and synthesis of publicly-available breach reports. In this study, we review nine (9) reports that meet four (4) criteria. We relate these criteria to the framework provided by COSO ERM Principle 15 by analyzing and placing the criteria into a taxonomy developed for this purpose. We analyze the degree to which the reports are complementary, reflect potential improvements of internal controls, and provide recommendations for ways in which these types of reports might be used by practitioners, while highlighting potential limitations. Our findings indicate that the sample reports contain little information that may be incorporated to improve the risk profile of an entity. We provide recommendations to improve the information content and timeliness of breach reports.},

However, the existing methods to safeguard email communication, including spam, phishing, and ham emails, have exhibited suboptimal classification performance and inadequate security. So, this work introduces the Optimized Email Classification Network (OECNet) to categorize emails and mitigate security risks effectively. Leveraging a hybrid dataset comprising spam, phishing, and ham email information, we perform meticulous preprocessing to ensure data uniformity.

Inspired by natural swarm behaviours, we employ Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to select highly correlated features from PCA outcomes, optimizing the model\textquotesingle s efficacy. The OECNet uses PSO-optimised features to integrate a Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network (DLCNN) model for classification.

In fact, the number of cyber crimes is exponentially growing in a scenario where the global COVID-19 pandemic determined several conditions that have negatively affected companies\textquotesingle  cyber-security posture. The adoption of risk management processes can help reduce security threats and mitigate both financial and reputation losses. In computer systems, it is crucial to relate security risks to the system infrastructure. Bayesian attack graph models can help reach such a goal. The approach is very effective as it allows to define the attack paths an attacker would perform against a specific network infrastructure. In this way, it is possible to construct a truthful representation of a company\textquotesingle s security risks that cannot be obtained with other approaches. Still, Bayesian risk management approaches are usually based on advanced threats. Namely, those threats relate to vulnerabilities that can only be exploited by a skilled attacker. Although several works enrich the expressiveness of the proposed Bayesian model, current proposals do not provide insights into how it is possible to estimate security control costs, asset values, and threat probabilities for other types of threats. Furthermore, they do not take insider threats into consideration. This work shows that a risk management framework based on Bayesian Attack Graphs can be adapted to include a variety of threats, including those related to the insiders. We first extend an interesting work based on Bayesian Decision Networks to cover a broader range of threats. Then, we formalize several concepts, such as security control coverage and risk strategy, and show that our model can easily integrate insider threats when specific properties are defined. Finally, in order to address insider threats, we enrich the model with security controls that differ from the standard ones, such as technical IT training sessions and employee satisfaction surveys.},

 abstract = {In this paper, the Search \& Heuristic Rule \& Logistic Regression (SHLR) combination detection method is proposed for detecting the obfuscation techniques commonly used by phishing websites and improving the filtering efficiency of legitimate webpages. The method is composed of three steps. First, the title tag content of the webpage is input as search keywords to the Baidu search engine, and the webpage is considered legal if the webpage domain matches the domain name of any of the top-10 search results; otherwise, further evaluation is performed. Second, if the webpage cannot be identified as legal, then the webpage is further examined to determine whether it is a phishing page based on the heuristic rules defined by the character features. The first two steps can quickly filter webpages to meet the needs of real-time detection. Finally, a logistic regression classifier is used to assess the remaining pages to enhance the adaptability and accuracy of the detection method. The experimental results show that the SHLR can filter 61.9\% of legitimate webpages and identify 22.9\% of phishing webpages based on uniform/universal resource locator (URL) lexical information. The accuracy of the SHLR is 98.9\%; thus, its phishing detection performance is high.},

 abstract = {Purpose
This paper aims to help build awareness with financial institutions about the money laundering risks posed by individuals who have been unknowingly recruited as Money Mules and the measures that financial institutions can adopt to detect illicit funds which are being received into the bank accounts of low risk or medium risk customers who are unknowingly recruited as \textquotedblleft Money Mules\textquotedblright .
Design/methodology/approach
The research took the form of a desk study, which analysed various documents and reports such as a 2019 report on Money Mules by the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (EUROPOL); a 2019 and 2020 report on Money Mules by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Better Business Bureau (BBB); the Financial Action Task Force Guidance on the Risk Based Approach to Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (High Level Principles and Procedures) 2007; the Financial Action Task Force Recommendations 2012; the United Kingdom’s Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017; the United States Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual 2014; Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index 2018; The UK Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (as amended); the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group JMLSG, Prevention of money laundering/combating terrorist financing: Guidance for the UK financial sector Part I June 2017 (Amended December 2017); the United States Codified Bank Secrecy Act Regulations (31 CFR); the Nigerian Money Laundering Prohibition Act 2011 (as amended); and the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group JMLSG, Prevention of money laundering/combating terrorist financing: Guidance for the UK financial sector Part II: Sectoral Guidance June 2017 (Amended December 2017).
Findings
This paper determined that financial institutions may be able to prevent proceeds of crime from being laundered by individuals who have been unknowingly recruited as Money Mules if they focus monitoring resources on the emotionally vulnerable customers like newcomers to the country, unemployed people who may have lost their jobs because of a pandemic like COVID-19, students and those in economic hardship; pay very close attention to the country of origin where the funds emanate from; pay very close attention to the country where the funds are being transferred to; and pay close attention to frequent large cash deposits followed by wire transfers.
Originality/value
While most articles focus on the money laundering risk(s) associated with Money Mules and the measures that individuals can use to ensure that their bank accounts are not used by criminals to launder illicit funds, this paper focuses on the different mechanisms that banks can use to detect illicit funds which are being received into the bank accounts of low risk or medium risk customers who are unknowingly recruited as \textquotedblleft Money Mules\textquotedblright . This paper recommends a proportional approach that balances anti-money laundering measures, financial inclusion and human rights. The mechanisms/measures which have been extensively discussed in this paper will help banks to identify, assess and understand their money laundering and terrorist financing risks as it relates to Money Mules and take commensurate measures to mitigate them.},

By the joint effort of the employees and the security analysts during the last two years, a large dataset of potentially malicious spam emails has been collected with each email being labeled as critical or irrelevant spam. By analyzing the main distinguishing characteristics of dangerous emails, a set of both traditional and novel features was identified and then tested and optimized by applying common supervised machine learning classifiers. The obtained massive experimental results show that Support Vector Machine and Random Forest classifiers achieve the best performance, with the optimized feature set of only 36 features achieving 91.6\% Recall and 95.2\% Precision. These results, confirmed by a large empirical experiment conducted on 40,000+ company employees, led to the re-engineering of the email threat management process to ensure a high level of security in the company, as well as an increased security awareness of all company employees.},

The results show that Internet security is a crucial determinant for Chinese firms to make location decisions overseas. Particularly, a secure Internet significantly promotes Chinese outward FDI to a host country. In contrast, Internet security in surrounding countries yields negative spatial location spillovers that hinder Chinese firms from investing in the host country. This phenomenon can be regarded as a national competition for Internet security to attract FDI. Mechanism tests show that Internet security promotes FDI in host countries through four channels: operating cost reductions, transaction cost-cutting, information asymmetry decreases, and confidentiality protection. Further heterogeneous analyses show that the impact of Internet security is more significant as time passes and the host country becomes an Internet society. In contrast, specific international cooperation frameworks led by China weaken the location effect of Internet security for Chinese outward FDI. These results are robust after controlling for potential endogeneity and to different specifications. Therefore, the host authorities should endeavor to create a high-quality Internet security environment to attract FDI.},

 abstract = {Digital identity refers to the information and attributes that uniquely identify an individual or entity in the digital world (Allison et al., 2005, [1]). It typically includes personal details such as name, date of birth, address, social security number, username, password, biometric data, and other identifying information. Digital identity is used for various online activities, including accessing websites, making online transactions, and interacting with digital services. Identity theft, on the other hand, is a criminal act in which someone wrongfully obtains and uses another person\textquotesingle s personal information without their consent, typically for fraudulent purposes (Anderson et al., 2008, [2]). This stolen information can be used to commit various crimes, such as financial fraud, unauthorized access to accounts, impersonation, and even opening new accounts in the victim\textquotesingle s name. Identity theft can occur through various means, including phishing scams, data breaches, hacking, malware, and physical theft of documents containing personal information (Tajpour et al., 2013, [3]). Once an individual\textquotesingle s identity is stolen, the thief can exploit it to gain unauthorized access to financial accounts, make fraudulent purchases, apply for loans or credit cards, and cause significant harm to the victim\textquotesingle s financial and personal well-being. Protecting one\textquotesingle s digital identity is crucial to minimize the risk of identity theft. This includes practices such as using strong, unique passwords for each online account, being cautious of phishing attempts, regularly monitoring financial statements and credit reports for suspicious activities and using secure networks and devices when accessing personal information online. In case of identity theft, individuals should promptly report the incident to the appropriate authorities and take steps to mitigate the damage caused (Bertino et al., 2019, [4]). This chapter provides a comprehensive exploration of the topic, covering its definition, historical context, methods employed by thieves, personal information at risk, impacts on individuals and society, prevention and protection strategies, detection and response measures, future trends, and real-life examples.

 abstract = {Blockchain has become popular in recent times through its data integrity and wide scope of applications. It has laid the foundation for cryptocurrencies such as Ripple, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and so on. Blockchain provides a platform for decentralization and trust in various applications such as finance, commerce, IoT, reputation systems, and healthcare. However, prevailing challenges like scalability, resilience, security and privacy are yet to be overcome. Due to rigorous regulatory constraints such as HIPAA, blockchain applications in the healthcare industry usually require more stringent authentication, interoperability, and record sharing requirements. This article presents an extensive study to showcase the significance of blockchain technology from both application and technical perspectives for healthcare domain. The article discusses the features and use-cases of blockchain in different applications along with the healthcare domain interoperability. The detailed working operation of the blockchain and the consensus algorithms are presented in the context of healthcare. An outline of the blockchain architecture, platforms, and classifications are discussed to choose the right platform for healthcare applications. The current state-of-the-art research in healthcare blockchain and available blockchain based healthcare applications are summarized. Furthermore, the challenges and future research opportunities along with the performance evaluation metrics in realizing the blockchain technology for healthcare are presented to provide insight for future research. We also layout the various security attacks on the blockchain protocol with the classifications of threat models and presented a comparative analysis of the detection and protection techniques. Techniques to enhance the security and privacy of the blockchain network is also discussed.},

 abstract = {On 19 August 2011, the ECOWAS Council of Ministers adopted Directive C/DIR.1/08/11 on Fighting Cybercrime at its Sixty Sixth Ordinary Session in Abuja, Nigeria. The adoption of the Directive at that time arose from the need to tackle the growing trend in cybercrime within the ECOWAS region, as some Member States were already gaining global notoriety as major sources of email scams and Internet fraud. Accordingly, the Directive established a legal framework for the control of cybercrime within the ECOWAS region, and also imposed obligations on Member States to establish the necessary legislative, regulatory and administrative measures to tackle cybercrime. In particular, the Directive required Member States to implement those obligations \textquotedblleft not later than 1st January, 2014{''}. This article undertakes an inquiry into the legal status of the Directive as an ECOWAS regional instrument in the domestic legal systems of Member States. In this regard, the article examines whether the requirement regarding the superiority or direct applicability of ECOWAS Community laws such as ECOWAS Acts and Regulations in the domestic legal systems of Member States also apply to ECOWAS Directives such as the Cybercrime Directive. The article also examines the legal implications of the Directive\textquotesingle s obligations for Member States. The article argues that while some Member States have not implemented the obligations under the Directive, that those obligations however provide a legal basis for holding Member States accountable, where the failure to implement has encouraged the perpetration of cybercrime that infringed fundamental rights guaranteed under human right instruments such as the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights or under their national laws.},

 abstract = {In the ever-changing cyber threat landscape, evolving malware threats demand a new technique for their detection. This paper puts forward a strategy for distinguishing malware programs based on transfer learning procedures. The proposed method, known as DTMIC \textemdash  deep transfer learning for malware image classification, leverages the capabilities of deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture previously trained with ImageNet dataset (>10 million images) for malware classification. Window’s portable executable files (PEs) are converted into grayscale images, with the perception that similar malware families fundamentally show the same characteristics when represented as visualized images. Grayscale images serve as input to the customized deep CNN architecture. Features extracted from the convolutional layers of the deep CNN model are flattened and fed into a fully connected dense layer. In addition, to avoid the overfitting problem that many CNN models face, a regularization technique called Early Stopping is employed to monitor the validation loss with configured parameters. The effectiveness and robustness of the model are evaluated on two benchmark datasets \textemdash  the MalImg dataset (9339 malware samples of 25 families) and the Microsoft BIG dataset (10868 malware samples of 9 families). DTMIC achieved 98.92\% test accuracy for MalImg datasets and 93.19\% for Microsoft datasets. For comparative analysis, well-established CNN architectures such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, and Google’s inceptionV3 are implemented, both as a feature extractor and a classifier. Experimental results reveal that the proposed DTMIC method outperforms the selected baseline models and is resilient to packed and encrypted malware. Moreover, this study validates the model’s efficacy on recent and real-world malware samples collected on Honeypots in the wild, with an accuracy of 96.43\%.},

We analyzed and coded over 100,000 ‘engaged’ tweets based on a component of mechanisms of moral disengagement (i.e., advantageous comparison), a linguistic device. The results reveal how respondents defend the actions of online fraudsters (\textquotedblleft the deviant group\textquotedblright ) by strategically comparing them to the wrongful acts of corrupt politicians (\textquotedblleft the respectable group\textquotedblright ). Similarly, the results show how respondents positioned this linguistic strategy to compare \textquotedblleft the powerless group\textquotedblright  (online fraudsters) and \textquotedblleft the powerful group\textquotedblright  (politicians) in society. Indeed, tweet responses suggest that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) generally looks downwards for culprits (i.e., online fraudsters) while ignoring fraudulent politicians.

This study examines the depiction of online fraudsters in thirty-three Nigerian hip-hop songs on nine popular streaming platforms such as Spotify, Deezer, iTunes, SoundCloud, Apple Music, and YouTube. Using a directed approach to qualitative content analysis, we coded lyrics based on the moral disengagement mechanism and core themes derived from existing literature. Our findings shed light on how songs (a) justify the fraudulent actions of online fraudsters, (b) blame and dehumanize victims of online romance fraud, (c) glamorize online fraud, and (d) provide insights into prevailing attitudes, indigenous linguistics, and worldviews regarding cybercrime victimization. Specifically, our analysis shows the presence of moral disengagement mechanisms, including "dehumanization," \textquotedblleft minimizing own agency,\textquotedblright  and "displacement of responsibility." Moreover, we identify core contextual themes pertinent to online fraud in the Nigerian context: (a) "cyber spiritualism" and (b) "the North-South divide."

 abstract = {This article has two main objectives. First, to interrogate the concept and/or conception of ‘economic crime’ (framed as a singular thing). We argue that current policy, and subsequently, social scientific (or criminological more specifically) framings, tend to arbitrarily ‘carve up’ the objects of study that interest us, in turn creating a ‘conceptual disorder’ that has implications for how we explain, and respond to, these harmful crimes. This raises questions about the value of the concept of ‘economic crime’ and about the related process of conceptual abstraction. In analytical terms, we argue that more can be gained by focusing on the necessary and contingent relations of serious crimes for economic gain. Second, to scrutinise the logic of ‘economic criminology’ (framed in terms of a singular discipline) and assess the value that criminology can add to analyses of related behaviours. Notwithstanding the journal’s aim to create a sub-field of ‘economic criminology’, we argue that research into the nature, organisation and control of serious crimes for economic gain ought to begin from the perspective of how we can create integrative, collaborative or multi-dimensional accounts of these behaviours in order to better organise, and identify, the most plausible explanations and interventions. To this end, we explore different ways of working interdisciplinarily, considering the underlying logic and/or rationale for doing so.},

 abstract = {Purpose
Phishing is one of the major threats affecting businesses worldwide in current times. Organizations and customers face the hazards arising out of phishing attacks because of anonymous access to vulnerable details. Such attacks often result in substantial financial losses. Thus, there is a need for effective intrusion detection techniques to identify and possibly nullify the effects of phishing. Classifying phishing and non-phishing web content is a critical task in information security protocols, and full-proof mechanisms have yet to be implemented in practice. The purpose of the current study is to present an ensemble machine learning model for classifying phishing websites.
Design/methodology/approach
A publicly available data set comprising 10,068 instances of phishing and legitimate websites was used to build the classifier model. Feature extraction was performed by deploying a group of methods, and relevant features extracted were used for building the model. A twofold ensemble learner was developed by integrating results from random forest (RF) classifier, fed into a feedforward neural network (NN). Performance of the ensemble classifier was validated using k-fold cross-validation. The twofold ensemble learner was implemented as a user-friendly, interactive decision support system for classifying websites as phishing or legitimate ones.
Findings
Experimental simulations were performed to access and compare the performance of the ensemble classifiers. The statistical tests estimated that RF\_NN model gave superior performance with an accuracy of 93.41 per cent and minimal mean squared error of 0.000026.
Research limitations/implications
The research data set used in this study is publically available and easy to analyze. Comparative analysis with other real-time data sets of recent origin must be performed to ensure generalization of the model against various security breaches. Different variants of phishing threats must be detected rather than focusing particularly toward phishing website detection.
Originality/value
The twofold ensemble model is not applied for classification of phishing websites in any previous studies as per the knowledge of authors.},

 abstract = {This study examines the demographic and organizational factors influencing phishing susceptibility and incident reporting behaviors among employees in a large European financial organization following realistic phishing simulations and how these factors correlate with susceptibility to phishing attacks. In the phishing simulations campaign with 8,102 participants, unannounced, monthly phishing emails with different templates are sent during regular work hours over a duration of 2 years, and the reactions (clicking the link and reporting the phishing email) are collected. The results are combined with demographic and relevant organizational data such as age, gender, level of education, department type, tenure, and job level. Multivariate logistic regression models are developed to analyze the relationship between these variables and phishing behaviors. The analysis reveals significant differences in susceptibility to and resilience against phishing attacks across various demographic and organizational groups. Older employees are more susceptible to phishing, while males show lower vulnerability to phishing attacks. Additionally, our results revealed that higher-level employees often under report phishing emails. These findings highlight the necessity for targeted anti-phishing training tailored to different demographics and departments within the organization and the importance of fostering a culture of incident reporting. Recommendations include customized cyber awareness training programs, regular awareness sessions, and incentivizing reporting. Future research is encouraged to prioritize investigating the root causes of phishing behaviors and evaluating the effectiveness of training programs.},

 abstract = {Why has the information security law been unsuccessful in having firms in possession of personal data take precautions against data breaches? Why are data breaches becoming more devastating notwithstanding law enforcement? This article seeks an answer from the legal system’s failure to draw a line between agency problems and externalities inherent in the information security market. Although a firm’s misaligned incentive to invest in security measures is basically an agency problem to be addressed by data breach litigation, the U.S. courts’ reluctance to grant Article III standing has reduced potential plaintiffs’ chance of winning and propensity to litigate, impairing the functionality of the private enforcement. As an exception, security vulnerabilities can have the nature of negative externalities to be addressed by the public enforcement, to the extent that those in \textquotedblleft key holders\textquotedblright  such as payment card processors enable intruders to easily circumvent the security measures taken by other firms in the same security chain, and that those in massive data aggregators undermine public trust in the whole data infrastructure. Government regulations, which need to be targeted at such sources of negative externalities, have actually been misaimed at a few cases arising from conventional agency problems. To test these hypotheses, this article presents an empirical study of security breach notifications filed in California during 2012\textendash 2016 and relevant court and government agency records produced until 2018.},

A systematic review was conducted to identify and analyze existing Pharma 4.0 frameworks. The examined frameworks were categorized into Manufacturing and Quality Management, Supply Chain Management, Clinical Trials and R\&D Digitalization, Workforce Competence, and Pharma 5.0. Analysis of the identified frameworks reveals that while they offer strategies for digital transformation, they focus solely on specific areas. In response, a conceptual Pharma 4.0 framework is proposed, emphasizing organizational readiness assessment, core technology integration, cybersecurity and data management, system integration, and continuous improvement. This framework provides a practical roadmap for Pharma 4.0 adoption, improving regulatory compliance and operational efficiency. Also, the framework supports a diverse range of pharmaceutical organizations, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Africa and other developing nations.

 abstract = {With confusion and uncertainty ruling the world, 2020 created near-perfect conditions for cybercriminals. As businesses virtually eliminated in-person experiences, the COVID-19 pandemic changed the way we live and caused a mass migration to digital platforms. However, this shift also made people more vulnerable to cyber-crime. Victims are being targeted by attackers for their credentials or financial rewards, or both. This is because the Internet itself is inherently difficult to secure, and the attackers can code in a way that exploits its flaws. Once the attackers gain root access to the devices, they have complete control and can do whatever they want. Consequently, taking advantage of highly unprecedented circumstances created by the Covid-19 event, cybercriminals launched massive phishing, malware, identity theft, and ransomware attacks. Therefore, if we wish to save people from these frauds in times when millions have already been tipped into poverty and the rest are trying hard to sustain, it is imperative to curb these attacks and attackers. This paper analyses the impact of Covid-19 on various cyber-security related aspects and sketches out the timeline of Covid-19 themed cyber-attacks launched globally to identify the modus operandi of the attackers and the impact of attacks. It also offers a thoroughly researched set of mitigation strategies which can be employed to prevent the attacks in the first place. Moreover, this manuscript proposes a fuzzy logic and data mining-based intelligence system for detecting Covid-19 themed malicious URL/phishing attacks. The performance of the system has been evaluated against various malicious/phishing URLs, and it was observed that the proposed system is a viable solution to this problem.},

Fintech and digital payment investigation must be regarded as a new technological subdiscipline within the digital forensics landscape. The digital forensics community is in a prime position to supply practitioners with research that will strengthen investigations involving Fintech and technical financial activities.

An example of a fraudulent scheme is a con artist posing as an authoritative figure in order to convince victims to purchase digital gift cards and provide the card usage code to the culprit. A review of an incident offers lessons that can be used to prevent future fraud-related losses and illustrates the multidisciplinary approach required to manage an incident and prevent future occurrences. An event response can be divided into four distinct phases: (1) fraud identification, (2) crisis management, (3) post-incident analysis, and (4) reporting to various communities. Lessons can be drawn from previous incidents in order to highlight the importance of forensic knowledge and crime analysis in interpreting the information conveyed by digital traces. From that information, innovative cross-disciplinary models can be developed for preventing, detecting, analysing, investigating, and responding to online fraud.},

Therefore, in this study the cybersecurity threat landscape for Botswana was investigated from the perspective of Information Technology (IT) and Cybersecurity professionals in Botswana. Since Botswana has no publicized empirical data on cyber threats, a cybersecurity incidences dataset from the United Kingdom (UK) was first analyzed to understand cybersecurity trends there. Insights obtained from the UK dataset were used as a baseline to design a questionnaire which was sent out to 31 participants from 20 organizations in Botswana. The findings obtained from the questionnaire were analyzed and compared to findings from the UK. This work showed that a coordinated response to cybersecurity and collection of information related to threats and mitigations can help improve situational awareness and defensive agility.},

This type of threat is called Business Email Compromise (BEC), which is a type of email phishing for financial purposes. This attack increased dramatically and caused very high financial losses to companies, especially in the period of remote work and in the Corona crisis, as it increased in the third quarter of the century of this year by 94\%. This type of threat does not require a high percentage of knowledge, experience, or skills in deception and fraud, it requires only a reasonable level of social engineering. In this paper, we contribute to analyze this threat is, how it occurs, ways to avoid it or reduce its incidence, and impact on the organization.},

 abstract = {Attackers are becoming more skilled in recent years, using sophisticated technology to produce look-alike emails that make it difficult to distinguish between real and fake ones. Most false emails can be detected, but certain undiscovered ones can be dangerous and compromise security. The attacker compromises SMTP to launch an email spoofing attack. This is not difficult given that it was designed without any security safeguards. Spoofers typically exploit the various fields in email headers. By taking advantage of loopholes in email security systems, attackers can create an ideal spoofing mail. As a result, it appears as a reliable source and succeeds in phishing attempts. An in-depth analysis of the email process, its protocols, and authentication mechanisms along with the security measures and adoption rates that led to a variety of spoofing attacks has been examined in our work. Our experiments on renowned mail service suppliers observed that some of them are still vulnerable to associated flaws. Further, we analyzed how different aspects such as age and education, determine whether or not a message is spoofed, and how malware uses email as a command and control to compromise the victim\textquotesingle s device and seize control of it. Further, it offers a multitude of mitigation strategies against spoofing attempts that aid aspirants in future research.},

Our methodology involved a systematic review of existing literature and empirical data from psychological experiments to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of various techniques, including Authority, Commitment \& Consistency, Reciprocity, and Group Pressure. The findings indicate that the Majority Size technique, measured by CCR, is particularly potent in scenarios with low initial compliance rates, while Authority, Commitment \& Consistency, and Reciprocity also demonstrate high effectiveness.

The sudden shift from offline to online activities and work may have resulted in new cybersecurity risks. The present study therefore examined changes in the prevalence, nature and impact of cybercrime among Dutch citizens and SME owners, during the pandemic. Qualitative interviews with ten experts working at various public and private organizations in the Netherlands that have insights into cybercrime victimization and data from victim surveys administrated in 2019 and 2021 were analyzed. The results show that there was only a small, non-statistically significant increase in the prevalence of cybercrime during the pandemic among citizens and SME owners. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic did have an impact on the modus operandi of cybercriminals: victims indicated that a considerable proportion of the offenses was related to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the case of online fraud. Moreover, the use of new applications and programs for work was associated with an increased risk of cybercrime victimization during the COVID-19 crisis. These results suggest that increases in rates of registered cybercrime that were found in previous studies might be the consequence of a reporting effect and that cybercriminals adapt their modus operandi to current societal developments.},

Although Phishing attacks have been known for more than two decades, and there is ongoing research for developing effective techniques against these attacks, the increasing trend of attacks confirms the lack of robust solutions and techniques against these attacks. According to Trend Micro, over 90 percent of all Cybersecurity attacks begin with spear Phishing emails and hence there is a need for comprehensive research in the area of anti-Phishing to improve the overall Cybersecurity landscape. This paper, therefore, performs a comprehensive study and analysis of past research work in anti-Phishing. The survey also tries to study various relationships such as those between the Phishers and the motives behind Phishing and explores/assesses various tactics that are employed for launching Phishing attacks. Highlighting the role of social and cognitive factors in the success of a Phishing attack which was not focused on in earlier reviews, is one of the major contributions of this work. The paper also provides a detailed understanding of the types of Phishers and the type of Phishing performed by them with a comprehensive classification of anti-Phishing detection/prevention/awareness solutions through a systematic literature review. The contributions of leading organizations and their active role through various anti-Phishing products are also discussed in this paper to bring light to the research and development happening in the industry with respect to anti-Phishing. Finally, the cyber laws to handle Phishing attacks in various countries have been presented for readers’ interest.

We systematize the deception techniques, focusing on techniques that use misleading sender, link, and/or attachment information. We identify 23 deception techniques which we classify as either those that email clients should protect users against (13) and those that email clients cannot protect against and thus should be addressed in security awareness measures (10). We propose a security rating for the susceptibility of email clients to these 13 deception techniques and perform an empirical evaluation to analyze the susceptibility of seven representative email clients (web, mobile apps, desktop apps) to these deception techniques. The results of our evaluation indicate that most email clients are in need of improvement to defend against the deception techniques.

Typically, one S-SF can be implemented by diverse configurations, each requiring different implementation costs and providing various security levels. These multi-configured S-SFs could compose various security-aware service function chains (S-SFCs) to satisfy the security requirement of an incoming network request. How to properly compose an S-SFC and effectively deploy it remains an open and challenging problem. In this work, we discover the \textquotedblleft reDundancy security AccumulatioN\textquotedblright  (DAN) phenomenon caused by the direct-summation-fashion when calculating the security level (SeL) of an S-SFC and propose a novel methodology to estimate the SeL of one S-SFC for avoiding DAN. To begin, we introduce the concept of security level indicator (SeLI) and our novel methodology. Next, we formulate the problem of security-aware SF selection, chaining, and deployment (Sec-SFCD) with the objective function of cost optimization and prove its NP-hardness. To solve this problem, we propose the security-cost-balance (SCB) factor technique, which measures the average cost of satisfying one unit of security requirement. Based on this technique, we further develop an efficient algorithm called SCB-based S-SFC deployment (SCB-SD) and improves it by proposing the overflowing security level elimination (OSE) technique. Through our thorough analysis, we show the logarithm-approximation of SCB-SD and SCB-SD with OSE technique (SSD-OSE). The extensive simulation results validate SSD-OSE’ s logarithm-approximation and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms the benchmarks directly extended from the state-of-the-art by an average of 17.98 \% and 67.47 \%.},

They possess deep language comprehension, human-like text generation capabilities, contextual awareness, and robust problem-solving skills, making them invaluable in various domains (e.g., search engines, customer support, translation). In the meantime, LLMs have also gained traction in the security community, revealing security vulnerabilities and showcasing their potential in security-related tasks. This paper explores the intersection of LLMs with security and privacy. Specifically, we investigate how LLMs positively impact security and privacy, potential risks and threats associated with their use, and inherent vulnerabilities within LLMs. Through a comprehensive literature review, the paper categorizes the papers into \textquotedblleft The Good\textquotedblright  (beneficial LLM applications), \textquotedblleft The Bad\textquotedblright  (offensive applications), and \textquotedblleft The Ugly\textquotedblright  (vulnerabilities of LLMs and their defenses). We have some interesting findings. For example, LLMs have proven to enhance code security (code vulnerability detection) and data privacy (data confidentiality protection), outperforming traditional methods. However, they can also be harnessed for various attacks (particularly user-level attacks) due to their human-like reasoning abilities. We have identified areas that require further research efforts. For example, Research on model and parameter extraction attacks is limited and often theoretical, hindered by LLM parameter scale and confidentiality. Safe instruction tuning, a recent development, requires more exploration. We hope that our work can shed light on the LLMs’ potential to both bolster and jeopardize cybersecurity.},
