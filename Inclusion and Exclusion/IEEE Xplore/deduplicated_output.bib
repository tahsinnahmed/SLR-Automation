 abstract = {This chapter sets out many cyber security terms which are frequently encountered or used with a specific context within the domain of cyber threat intelligence. Cyber threat intelligence is the study of threats. Importantly, threats do not necessarily need to be actively malicious. Threats can be accidental or forces of nature. Cyber security is about managing risks. The business email compromise is a type of scam that relies on human error. Threat actors can range from individuals working on their own who attack systems for no other motivation than to have fun or to demonstrate their technical prowess, to teams of salaried government employees who launch attacks to further the geopolitical aims of a nation state. Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures are descriptions of how a threat actor goes about attempting to achieve their desired goal.},

Vulnerability chaining attacks have only recently become part of the mainstream conversation of vulnerability management, but they have been leveraged by advanced persistent threat groups for many years. Based on that data, it\textquotesingle s absolutely possible for attackers to leverage older vulnerabilities to conduct critical vulnerability chaining attacks. The chapter provides specific vendor examples. It includes different examples of how users can be a component of vulnerability chaining, including phishing, business email compromise, and other social engineering tactics. Vulnerability chaining attacks can be used to compromise all systems, drop ransomware, or steal corporate data to sell on the dark web. Many security practitioners may already be aware of the vulnerability chaining attacks leveraged against users and systems.},

 abstract = {Business email compromise is a tool used by adversaries to attack various organizations. Detecting such cyberattacks using well-known methods is becoming increasingly difficult. This paper proposes an approach based on natural language processing and deep neural networks, such as BiGRU and CNN, to detect business email compromise attacks. Semantic features are extracted from emails using a pre-trained BERT model. At the same time, the BiGRU and CNN models allow local feature extraction from emails. Three datasets of different sizes containing phishing and legitimate emails are considered for the experiments. Comparison results with other well-known methods demonstrate the applicability of the proposed Hybrid BERT+BiGRU+CNN model, outperforming them and showing accuracy of 99.59\%, 98.77\%, and 98.67\% on the Ling-Spam, Enron-Spam, and TREC 2007 datasets, respectively. The proposed approach is a tool for business email compromise detection, providing various organizations with an effective solution against cyberattacks.},

 abstract = {The MITRE ATT\&CK (Registered trademark) framework is a globally recognized repository of adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) based on real-world cyber threats. It provides a model for analyzing attack behaviors and enhancing incident attribution. Business Email Compromise (BEC) frauds, a growing cyber threat, exploit email communications for financial gain. However, the MITRE framework is not widely used for BEC, as no custom matrix has been developed specifically for these attacks. This study maps the TTPs used by BEC Threat Actors (TA) within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework. The methodology included a review of academic literature, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports, and real-world incident response data from INCIDE Digital Data S.L. A total of 10 tactics, 34 techniques, and 46 sub-techniques were identified, with 5 new sub-techniques proposed to address gaps, particularly in mailbox manipulation and defense evasion. Additionally, Privilege Escalation, Lateral Movement, and Credential Access tactics were merged due to overlapping techniques, while the Execution tactic was excluded as it is not central to BEC attacks. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, we characterized two real-world TAs: Cosmic Lynx, a sophisticated actor targeting multinational organizations, and Chiffon Herring, a smaller-scale attacker employing simpler methods. These case studies highlight the frameworkâ€™s adaptability for analyzing diverse TA profiles and its potential to support improved incident attribution, detection, and prevention strategies.},

 abstract = {Email spoofing is a method of scamming individuals by impersonating a trusted correspondent via email. Incidences of successful Business Email Compromise (BEC) implemented by email spoofing are rising astronomically. Existing security systems are not widely implemented and cannot provide perfect protection against a technological threat that relies on social engineering for success. When existing security systems are implemented the settings are generally not restrictive enough to catch the more sophisticated email attacks. Businesses are not comfortable with legitimate emails being lost due to security false positives. Our idea for a solution would add a layer to existing precautions that would permit looser server-side security settings but would warn the user when discrepancies occur in the header source code that could result from a spoofed email. We suggest a client-side sentinel to vet email header source code and alert the user to potential problems. This software could log alerts, notify company officials, remind users of company policies to be followed in the event of suspicious email, and could increase user accountability by logging incidents. Users could have the option of white-listing frequently flagged trusted correspondents which would decrease the annoyance of false positives.},

 abstract = {Human failure is the weakest link in many, if not most, security systems. As a result, criminals are increasingly relying on social engineering as a way to circumvent security controls. To improve their yield, criminals constantly experiment with methods aimed at making their attacks harder to detect\textemdash both to security systems and to the end users behind them. Naturally, an attack that successfully evades detection by both human and machine has the potential to make criminals very wealthy. Therefore, once discovered and successfully tested, such attacks exhibit dramatic growth and are commonly copied and tweaked by other criminals spotting an opportunity when they see it. What we term the launchpad attack is the newest example of such an attack. This attack is also commonly referred to as a business email compromise (BEC) that uses account takeover. Although it was virtually unheard of just a few years ago, 44\% of organizations have now experienced this type of attack according to a recent industry report.<sup>1</sup>},

We introduce a straightforward yet highly practical method of creating a checksum from the invoice and shared secret information. Using the generated checksum allows the recipient to confirm the authenticity and integrity of the invoice before proceeding with the actual payment. In this work, generating and verifying of checksum information are done via a smartphone application. Also, the predetermined secret information is stored inside the smartphone to provide better protection against data theft. Lastly, an Android-based application for checksum generation and verification, supporting both manual input and QR code scan, is implemented to demonstrate the use case scenario and practicability of the proposed method.},

 abstract = {Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a method through which the attacker defrauds the organization and all its stake holders by the use of the business email that the employees carelessly use in public domain. This paper discusses about Business Email Compromise (BEC) that can be identified and categorized into five broad categories which are, CEO Fraud, Bogus Invoice Scheme, Account Compromise, Lawyer/Attorney Impersonation, and Data Theft. The research majorly focuses on finding the techniques used for BEC, detection techniques that could be used for taking the corrective measures against the attack and finding the possible countermeasures for preventing the BEC attack. The major techniques used by attackers and criminals for performing a BEC attack are usually Credential- grabbing and Email-only Method. Credential-grabbing techniques include techniques like phishing-related techniques and malware-related techniques. Phishing-related techniques can include compromise using various methods like from Direct Links, PDF Files, HTML or File-hosting services. Detection of such attacks can be done by various methods, such as Impersonation classifier, content classifier, text classifier, link classifier, classifier algorithm. There is BEC-Guard that can be installed in order to track these methods. Name and nickname matching is a method where in order to detect name spoofing, the impersonation classifier needs to match the sender name with a name of an employee. Countermeasures are the best possible way to prevent the BEC attack in the first place and the best defense for countermeasure is a well-informed workforce. Majorly, the countermeasures used includes, training and awareness programs, Phishing attack trainings, using of SPF, DKIM, DMARC anti-spoofing and email authentication techniques.},

 abstract = {We identify over a quarter of a million domains used by medium and large companies within the .com registry. We find that for around 7\% of these companies very similar domain names have been registered with character changes that are intended to be indistinguishable at a casual glance. These domains would be suitable for use in Business Email Compromise frauds. Using historical registration and name server data we identify the timing, rate, and movement of these look-alike domains over a ten year period. This allows us to identify clusters of registrations which are quite clearly malicious and show how the criminals have moved their activity over time in response to countermeasures. Although the malicious activity peaked in 2016, there is still sufficient ongoing activity to cause concern.},
