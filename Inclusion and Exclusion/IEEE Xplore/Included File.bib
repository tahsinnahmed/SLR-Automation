This paper introduces a forward-looking approach, the Cognitive Email Analysis with Automated Decision Support mechanism, tailored to confront the challenges of Business Email Compromise prevention. Cognitive Email Analysis with Automated Decision Support mechanism leverages cognitive analysis, artificial intelligence, and automated decision support to discern linguistic nuances and contextual cues within email communications. By doing so, it aims to detect Business Email Compromise threats and enhance users\textquotesingle   decision-making capa-bilities, fostering a proactive cybersecurity stance. This paper presents a comprehensive conceptual framework of the Cognitive Email Analysis with Automated Decision Support mechanism, highlighting its potential to revolutionize the landscape of Busi-ness Email Compromise prevention.},

 abstract = {Business email compromise is a tool used by adversaries to attack various organizations. Detecting such cyberattacks using well-known methods is becoming increasingly difficult. This paper proposes an approach based on natural language processing and deep neural networks, such as BiGRU and CNN, to detect business email compromise attacks. Semantic features are extracted from emails using a pre-trained BERT model. At the same time, the BiGRU and CNN models allow local feature extraction from emails. Three datasets of different sizes containing phishing and legitimate emails are considered for the experiments. Comparison results with other well-known methods demonstrate the applicability of the proposed Hybrid BERT+BiGRU+CNN model, outperforming them and showing accuracy of 99.59\%, 98.77\%, and 98.67\% on the Ling-Spam, Enron-Spam, and TREC 2007 datasets, respectively. The proposed approach is a tool for business email compromise detection, providing various organizations with an effective solution against cyberattacks.},

 abstract = {The MITRE ATT\&CK (Registered trademark) framework is a globally recognized repository of adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) based on real-world cyber threats. It provides a model for analyzing attack behaviors and enhancing incident attribution. Business Email Compromise (BEC) frauds, a growing cyber threat, exploit email communications for financial gain. However, the MITRE framework is not widely used for BEC, as no custom matrix has been developed specifically for these attacks. This study maps the TTPs used by BEC Threat Actors (TA) within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework. The methodology included a review of academic literature, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports, and real-world incident response data from INCIDE Digital Data S.L. A total of 10 tactics, 34 techniques, and 46 sub-techniques were identified, with 5 new sub-techniques proposed to address gaps, particularly in mailbox manipulation and defense evasion. Additionally, Privilege Escalation, Lateral Movement, and Credential Access tactics were merged due to overlapping techniques, while the Execution tactic was excluded as it is not central to BEC attacks. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, we characterized two real-world TAs: Cosmic Lynx, a sophisticated actor targeting multinational organizations, and Chiffon Herring, a smaller-scale attacker employing simpler methods. These case studies highlight the frameworkâ€™s adaptability for analyzing diverse TA profiles and its potential to support improved incident attribution, detection, and prevention strategies.},

 abstract = {This research presents a practical countermeasure against the problem of the bogus invoice scheme, one of the most threatening BEC attacks in modern business. We introduce a straightforward yet highly practical method of creating a checksum from the invoice and shared secret information. Using the generated checksum allows the recipient to confirm the authenticity and integrity of the invoice before proceeding with the actual payment. In this work, generating and verifying of checksum information are done via a smartphone application. Also, the predetermined secret information is stored inside the smartphone to provide better protection against data theft. Lastly, an Android-based application for checksum generation and verification, supporting both manual input and QR code scan, is implemented to demonstrate the use case scenario and practicability of the proposed method.},

 abstract = {Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a method through which the attacker defrauds the organization and all its stake holders by the use of the business email that the employees carelessly use in public domain. This paper discusses about Business Email Compromise (BEC) that can be identified and categorized into five broad categories which are, CEO Fraud, Bogus Invoice Scheme, Account Compromise, Lawyer/Attorney Impersonation, and Data Theft. The research majorly focuses on finding the techniques used for BEC, detection techniques that could be used for taking the corrective measures against the attack and finding the possible countermeasures for preventing the BEC attack. The major techniques used by attackers and criminals for performing a BEC attack are usually Credential- grabbing and Email-only Method. Credential-grabbing techniques include techniques like phishing-related techniques and malware-related techniques. Phishing-related techniques can include compromise using various methods like from Direct Links, PDF Files, HTML or File-hosting services. Detection of such attacks can be done by various methods, such as Impersonation classifier, content classifier, text classifier, link classifier, classifier algorithm. There is BEC-Guard that can be installed in order to track these methods. Name and nickname matching is a method where in order to detect name spoofing, the impersonation classifier needs to match the sender name with a name of an employee. Countermeasures are the best possible way to prevent the BEC attack in the first place and the best defense for countermeasure is a well-informed workforce. Majorly, the countermeasures used includes, training and awareness programs, Phishing attack trainings, using of SPF, DKIM, DMARC anti-spoofing and email authentication techniques.},

 abstract = {We identify over a quarter of a million domains used by medium and large companies within the .com registry. We find that for around 7\% of these companies very similar domain names have been registered with character changes that are intended to be indistinguishable at a casual glance. These domains would be suitable for use in Business Email Compromise frauds. Using historical registration and name server data we identify the timing, rate, and movement of these look-alike domains over a ten year period. This allows us to identify clusters of registrations which are quite clearly malicious and show how the criminals have moved their activity over time in response to countermeasures. Although the malicious activity peaked in 2016, there is still sufficient ongoing activity to cause concern.},
